# Description

This project focused on building a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for pizza sales analysis, leveraging both SQL and Tableau's robust data visualization tools. The process began with data extraction and preparation, where SQL was used to efficiently manage and structure large datasets. Once the data was cleaned and transformed, it was imported into Tableau to develop dynamic, interactive visualizations. The dashboard provides valuable insights into key sales metrics, including top-selling products, sales trends, and customer preferences, empowering data-driven decisions for the business. This project highlights the successful application of SQL and Tableau to turn raw data into actionable insights, driving strategy and performance in the retail food industry.
